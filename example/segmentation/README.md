# Segmentation Examples

This folder contains examples for boundary based segmentation approaches that can
be implemented with the `elf.segmentation` module.
In addition to the dependencies that are installed with the `elf` conda package,
you will need [napari](https://github.com/napari/napari) for visualisation and
[affogato](https://github.com/constantinpape/affogato) if you want to run the mutex watershed example.
